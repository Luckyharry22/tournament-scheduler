# tournament-scheduler
This Python code employs a greedy algorithm and custom data structures to schedule a round-robin tournament for a given number of teams. It ensures each team plays all others twice, once at each team's home ground, while avoiding common opponents on the same day. Users input the number of teams, and the code prints the tournament schedule.
